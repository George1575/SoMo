  "A Level Biology will offer you an exciting, challenging and stimulating area of study. Biology encompasses the cellular basis of living things, the transformation of energy that underlies the activities of life, and the genetic basis for inheritance in organisms. You will study the evolutionary relationships between organisms and the diversity of life on earth, to include microorganisms, plants, and animals. The structural and functional relationships studied in biology draw on the sciences of chemistry and physics for its foundations and applies the laws of these disciplines to living things. You will learn about advanced biology concepts and put these into practice through a wide variety of practical experiments.
